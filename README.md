# Virtual-Stock
CS 5010 Project

An application that helps users who are new to investing to learn about how money could grow, in the style of "virtual gambling". Similar to virtual gambling, our application will not use real money and investment. Instead it will allow the user to create investment portfolios, try out buying and selling of stock, and various investment strategies to see how they can grow (or shrink) their money with time.
