<h1>Virtual Stock</h1>
<p>An application that helps users who are new to investing to learn about how money could grow,
in the style of "virtual gambling".
Similar to virtual gambling, our application will not use real money and investment.
<p>Instead, it will allow the user to create investment portfolios,
try out buying and selling of stock, and various investment strategies
to see how they can grow (or shrink) their money with time.
<h3> Features </h3>
<p> List of features which are implemented in the Virtual Stock program.</p>
<ol>
    <li> <b> Allow a user to create one or more portfolios with shares of one or more stock. </b>
         </li>
        <ul>
            <li>User can create 2 types of portfolios- flexible and inflexible.</li>
            <li>Inflexible portfolios cannot be edited once created.</li>
            <li>User can update(buy/sell more stocks) flexible portfolio after creation.</li>
            <li>Our program supports one user which is active user.</li>
            <li>User data is stored in file database system.</li>
            <li>There are 3 ways by which user can create portfolios.</li>
                <h4> Initializing portfolios</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>User can start with a blank portfolio.</li>
                    <li>User can load previous non-empty portfolio from the file database.</li>
                    <li>User can load a single external file that contains list of portfolio
                        in csv format.
                        </br> Format for each row (Inflexible) : portfolio name, ticker symbol, quantity, false (flag for inflexible).
                        </br> Format for each row (Flexible) : portfolio name, ticker symbol, quantity, true (flag for flexible),
                        transaction date (YYYY-MM-DD), commission fee, buy (true/false)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All the above options, once selected will overwrite the previous profile
                    in the user database file.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While loading existing or external portfolios,
                    if there is any IOException because of error during file operations,
                    an appropriate message is displayed.
                    </br>
                    An appropriate error message is displayed for invalid inputs.
                    Invalid inputs : Quantity less than 1, Non-integer quantity,
                    commission fee less than or equal to 0.
                    </br>If ticker symbol does not exist, then corresponding stock is skipped in the portfolio.
